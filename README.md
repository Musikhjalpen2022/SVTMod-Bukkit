# SVTMod-Bukkit
Watch the Swedish national television streaming service SVT-play with others in Minecraft. This is the server implementation for Bukkit. Supports SVTmod-Fabric users while also allowing you to use your average Bukkit server (Spigot, Paper, etc). Vanilla clients are still able to join, just not see the cinema screens. Note that this repo is forked and that original is still under development and not released.

Requires: WorldGuard (and WorldEdit), ProtocolLib
